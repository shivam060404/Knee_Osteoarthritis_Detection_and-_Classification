# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to detect and classify knee osteoarthritis from X-ray images. Using a convolutional neural network based on ResNet50, the system categorizes knee X-rays into different osteoarthritis severity levels.

## Features
- Preprocessing of knee X-ray images
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Transfer learning with ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet
- Multi-class classification of osteoarthritis severity (5 classes)
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Model checkpointing and early stopping

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- SciKeras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

## Dataset Structure
The dataset should be organized as follows:
```
train/
  ├── class_0/
  ├── class_1/
  ├── class_2/
  ├── class_3/
  └── class_4/
val/
  ├── class_0/
  ├── class_1/
  ├── class_2/
  ├── class_3/
  └── class_4/
test/
  ├── class_0/
  ├── class_1/
  ├── class_2/
  ├── class_3/
  └── class_4/
```

Where each class represents a different severity level of knee osteoarthritis (likely using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale).

## Model Architecture
- Base model: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Additional layers:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dense layer (256 units, ReLU activation)
  - Output layer (5 units, softmax activation)

## Usage
1. Mount your Google Drive (if using Google Colab)
2. Set up the data directories for training, validation, and testing
3. Run the data preprocessing and augmentation
4. Train the model with hyperparameter tuning
5. Evaluate the model on the test set

## Data Preprocessing
- Resizing images to 224x224 pixels
- Conversion to grayscale
- Data augmentation:
  - Rotation
  - Width/height shifts
  - Shearing
  - Zooming
  - Horizontal flipping

## Training Process
- Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
- Categorical cross-entropy loss function
- Accuracy metric
- Early stopping with patience of 10 epochs
- Model checkpointing to save the best model

## Performance Visualization
The training history is plotted to visualize:
- Training and validation accuracy
- Training and validation loss

## Future Improvements
- Implementation of Grad-CAM for model interpretability
- Ensemble learning with multiple models
- External validation on different datasets
- Integration with a user-friendly interface for clinical use
